# Responsive-Fashion-Website
This is a two-page responsive fashion-focused website created as part of my NAIT Web Development coursework. The project demonstrates modal windows, accordion components, horizontal scrolling UI, form validation states, and responsive layout techniques. It was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.
